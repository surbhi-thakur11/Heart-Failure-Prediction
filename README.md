# Heart-Failure-Prediction

## Objective: 
There are some factors that affects Death Event. This dataset contains person's information like age ,sex , blood pressure, smoke, diabetes,ejection fraction, creatinine phosphokinase, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, time and we have to predict their DEATH EVENT.

## Columns: 

 Age: Age of the patient in years
Anaemia: Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (0:Reduced or 1:Normal)
creatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
Diabetes: If the patient has diabetes (0:No or 1:Yes)
ejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
high_blood_pressure: If the patient has hypertension (0:No or 1:Yes)
platelets: Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
serum_creatinine: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
serum_sodium: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
sex: Biological sex of the patient (0:Female or 1:Male)
smoking: If the patient is a smoker (0:No or 1: Yes)
time: Follow-up period in days
death_event: If the patient survived till the end of follow-up period (0:No or 1:Yes )
